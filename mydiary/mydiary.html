                        My bbcat and I studied in the library during the day. I felt that my bbcat was tired 
                        from work, as he has to work really hard during the day (on weekdays). So, I proposed 
                        going out at night. We went to a shopping mall on the way to the station, and my bbcat 
                        fell in love with a bottle of farm animals, especially the bull and horse. 😂

                        My bbcat came to me after he was off work at night. We bought grapes and water on my

                        I made a one-page PPT for today's meeting in our research group. It's the first time 
                        I understood the paper the senior shared. It felt like a class without any break time 😭. 
                        When I got back to the dorm, I felt overwhelmed and didn't want to do anything.

                        I woke up at 8 a.m. this morning, feeling too lazy to have breakfast. I drank a bottle 
                        of milk and ate an apple, the only edible things I had in the dorm. I spent the morning 
                        learning about diffusion with a simple code example. While it was training, I went down 
                        to eat a bowl of noodles for lunch, then headed to the library.<br>
                        My bbcat had a bit of a chaotic day. He forgot to bring his employee badge and had to go 
                        back to retrieve it at noon. When he arrived, he realized he had forgotten his key again 
                        and had to return to get it. The frequent trips caused his pants broken like cheongsams 
                        because he always carries two phones, and the weight pulled them down. My bbcat worked 
                        so hard today that he forgot to eat dinner. By the time he was off work, his hands were 
                        shaking. My poor little baby ended up eating McDonald's while we talked on the phone at night.<br>
                        On a happier note, I discovered that the cats on my campus actually have a home here. 
                        Someone made a tiny house for two cats and provided them with food and water.

                        Today is Monday, and I was supposed to have a class, but it got rescheduled. So, 
                        I stayed with my bbcat this morning. We woke up at 8 a.m., both took a shower, 
                        and then took a bus to my bbcat's workplace. He treated me to breakfast at McDonald's, 
                        which I used to think was bad but now seems to taste good.</br>
                        After breakfast, I went back to campus while my bbcat went to work. When I arrived, 
                        I saw a HeyTea and ordered my favorite drink. I love the smashed grape with cheese 
                        cream cover—it tastes great. On my way to the library, I came across a white guy who 
                        greeted me with a "hello," and I greeted him back. I've never been greeted by strangers 
                        before, and it felt unexpectedly good.</br>
                        I left the library when it closed, and they were playing Justin Bieber's "Love Yourself." 
                        I kind of want to stay there every day until closing just to listen to the songs. When I 
                        checked my phone, my bbcat told me he had forgotten his door key in his light jacket, 
                        which he left at his workplace. My poor bbcat! He had to go back to retrieve it, wailing 
                        about how his good time off work was wasted. Cute baby!</br>
                        I was feeling sad earlier because I had no time to study and was struggling to finish 
                        my work. So, my bbcat tried not to disturb me and asked me to end our phone call after a 
                        few minutes of chatting. I refused and talked with him until he arrived at his place, 
                        where he lit up the black candle lantern.

                        In the morning, my bbcat felt sad and cried badly for some reason. Later, 
                        we went to IKEA to buy a solid, steady, big desk for him. The previous desk was 
                        small and wobbled while typing, so we needed a good one to study together. We've 
                        visited the IKEA in Tsingtao before and had a wonderful experience, but this time, 
                        there were so many people!</br>
                        Despite the crowd, we successfully bought a white desk that was inexpensive and 
                        nice—we both love it. We also came across other interesting items and bought some. 
                        We saw a wooden hand with its middle finger tied to prevent people from making rude 
                        gestures—haha. We got a cute black candle lantern made of metal and glass, along 
                        with some red candles that had a sweet fruit smell. We also bought a handmade 
                        sunflower and three carnations in white and pink, along with many useful little things.
                        At night, I felt sad and cried badly for some reason.

                        I came to my bbcat tonight. He lay on his soft bed until I arrived at the station, 
                        then rushed to me on a shared bike, sweating as if it were raining. After we finished 
                        dinner and headed back, we came across a cow cat. I fed it a cat stick, and it 
                        began to follow me. A young lady warned me that this cat would scratch people. 
                        I immediately left, and my bbcat protected me from this naughty cat.

                        This morning, I fed the ginger cat I met on September 17th. It always appears around the 
                        canteen in the early morning. This little cat is afraid of rushing people but not of those 
                        who approach it slowly. I noticed it had lost its canine tooth, so I thought a cat treat 
                        stick might suit it better. (I don't have much experience feeding cats.)</br>

                        In today's class, my teacher mentioned that technique is not the most important skill in 
                        the workplace—communication is. Often, project delays are caused by Party A, who frequently 
                        requests changes to the product's functionality and is uncertain about what they truly need.

                        This morning, when I got up, all my roommates had already left. I opened the pomegranate 
                        my roommate had given me, only to find it wriggling with little white worms. I threw it 
                        straight into the bin.</br>
                        During today's class, I noticed a boy sitting in front of me working on his own website. 
                        His looked more business-like, while mine looked more childish—haha. I also discovered 
                        that the international student in my class can speak Chinese, which is quite different 
                        from the students I met at OUC.</br>
                        After class, I tried to chat with my supervisor's daughter (How dare I am..). 
                        She seemed a bit shy and nervous, so I decided to leave. I'm not sure how to make friends 
                        with children.</br>
                        In the evening, I read papers in the library. When it was 15 minutes before closing time, 
                        the loudspeakers started playing pop music. It was a bit strange, but I liked it. 
                        I love music! ❤️

                        I went to the old campus by school bus today to attend a meeting. There were many international 
                        students on the bus. As I was about to get off, an international student asked a boy passing by 
                        where Building 8 was. The boy couldn't understand him due to his thick accent and walked away. 
                        I offered to help, and the student gave me his phone so I could type in the building name and 
                        find it on Amap.</br>
                        After the meeting, one of the senior students shared a very large mooncake with us—bigger than 
                        my face! When I returned to the new campus, I realized how beautiful it is in its own way.

                        Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and I went back home with my bbcat. He bought some crabs, 
                        durian, and snacks. Before we went there, he got a haircut because he didn't want to meet my 
                        parents with his long, messy hair. Cute.😚🥰 It took us almost 2 hours to get everything done.</br>

                        My mom got off work earlier than usual to see me and enjoy my cooking—haha. Unfortunately, 
                        the water supply was broken today, making it difficult to cook. With my parents' help, though, 
                        we managed to have a great big dinner. After dinner, we relaxed and chatted for a while. My bbcat 
                        had to go back, and my dad offered to take him to the railway station. </br>

                        I wanted to go back to school because there was a slim chance I could take a shower at home (I 
                        thought there still wouldn't be water at night). When I arrived at the subway station, it was 
                        packed with people, making it hard to call a car. After waiting for 30 minutes, I couldn't wait 
                        any longer and decided to walk back to school. It was raining and thundering, so my bbcat worried 
                        about me and made a video call to check in and see if there were any buses available. Love you!</br>

                        When I got back to the dorm, my roommate told me it was her birthday. I wished her a happy 
                        birthday and got a piece of cake from her.

                        This morning, on my way to the canteen for breakfast, I accidentally stepped on cat poop 💩
                        because I was looking at my phone and didn't notice it until I felt something soft under my shoe. 
                        I had a full day of classes (no night classes, thankfully). After dinner, I spent almost three 
                        hours figuring out how to use Nutstore to synchronize documents and notes between my laptop and 
                        tablet in the cloud.</br>
                        Once that was done, I finally had some time to relax. I watched short videos of my favorite internet

                        little daughter. After the classes (which I must say were the friendliest ones I've had for the only
                        international classmate this semester), the girl came up to the platform and started drawing cute cats🐱 and 
                        bunnies🐰 on the blackboard. She was energetic, running around the classroom, and absolutely adorable.
                        I also took the opportunity to discuss some questions about my research field with my supervisor. 
                        I learned something new and valuable. Thanks to my supervisor and his little daughter!

                        Daily Routine:
                        Today, I woke up at 9:00, and everyone else was already up and gone. 
                        I went to the library to read and took a nap around 3 p.m. In the evening, 
                        I picked up all my packages and returned to the dorm. After taking a shower, 
                        I washed both my dirty and new clothes. My bbcat finished work and asked for 
                        my love. 😚 I went to the balcony to talk with my bbcat.

                    The Opening Ceremony of the university is awesome! The the warm up act was great, loved the Matador song. 
                    It really makes me feels like I'm part of a big family!

                        We had the Opening Ceremony for our department today, and I met a really nice 
                        soccer girl—she's so cute and friendly! After the ceremony, I went to the dentist 
                        for the last time. I need to care of my baby teeth! I bought a box of mooncakes for my 
                        previous roommate, and my bbcat got me a ticket for a Spicy Comedy show and a plane ticket. 
                        Love my bbcat! Big kiss for you! 😚</br>

                        After that, I went to the campus library and read a book about RFID. Meeting the badminton 
                        girl and the soccer girl made me realize that I've never stuck with something for a long time 
                        and done it really well. I usually have a brief, intense interest in things. But whatever, 
                        I'm happy, and that's enough. I don't need to spend a lot of time practicing to prove I'm good—
                        I'm already doing great!

                        Today, I realized just how much I've changed—or maybe it's more accurate to say that the real me 
                        finally came out! I joined a badminton game with a group of strangers; I only knew two of them, 
                        and even then, we had only met once or twice before.</br>
                        Before the game, I felt confident in my badminton skills. But during the match, I quickly realized 
                        that I had never really played by the rules, and I wasn't as good as I thought. Every time the 
                        shuttlecock came to my left, I missed it about 80% of the time.</br>
                        However, the five people I played with were incredibly kind and patiently taught me. Normally, 
                        I would get nervous and hesitate to play when I'm the weakest one in the group. But they were 
                        so supportive, and I've come to accept that sometimes, I will be the worst in certain areas. 
                        The important thing is to do my best and keep getting stronger.

                        Today, I became the vice monitor of my class. I remember how nervous 
                        I was in the past when I thought about running for a position—I kept 
                        rehearsing my speech over and over in my mind. But still didn't do well. 
                        But after serving as an interim class leader for the past few days, I've gained
                        some confidence. Even though I might still stumble over my words and lack 
                        perfect logic when I speak, I'm not as timid as I used to be, and I feel 
                        great about it.
                        <br>Initially, I didn't plan on becoming one of the class leader, but these 
                        past few days have made me realize that there are certain skills I need to 
                        develop. While this role may not be the perfect way to build those abilities, 
                        I'm willing to give it a try. Plus, I've made some great friends along the way, 
                        and that makes me really happy today.

                        I started building my own website today, HURRAY!🎉🎉
                        I'm so happy that I can create something, for free! LOL.
                        Actually I felt hard to fall asleep recently. 
                        I feel very anxiety about my future.
                        I don't know what to do to relieve it.
                        Everynight I go to bed at 12 p.m, but couldn't sleep until 2 a.m.
                        This situation already last for about 2 weeks. 
                        I really miss the days that I could fall asleep in 10 mins.😂
                        Now I just can't help thinking something have nothing to do with me.
                        Trying hard to get through it!💪💪

                        This website is a bit ugly.. Beutify it next time.

                        Yesterday, I fell asleep a bit early, like 1 a.m, a biiiig progress!
                        And I also ate a delicious small piece of cake! Like each of them 
                        is as large as my little palm. I can eat 100 pieces!🤤
