                        Daily Routine:
                        Today, I woke up at 9:00, and everyone else was already up and gone. 
                        I went to the library to read and took a nap around 3 p.m. In the evening, 
                        I picked up all my packages and returned to the dorm. After taking a shower, 
                        I washed both my dirty and new clothes. My bbcat finished work and asked for 
                        my love. ðŸ˜š I went to the balcony to talk with my bbcat.
                    </p>

                    The Opening Ceremony of the university is awesome! The the warm up act was great, loved the Matador song. 
                    It really makes me feels like I'm part of a big family!
                    </p>

                        We had the Opening Ceremony for our department today, and I met a really nice 
                        soccer girlâ€”she's so cute and friendly! After the ceremony, I went to the dentist 
                        for the last time. I need to care of my baby teeth! I bought a box of mooncakes for my 
                        previous roommate, and my bbcat got me a ticket for a Spicy Comedy show and a plane ticket. 
                        Love my bbcat! Big kiss for you! ðŸ˜š

                        After that, I went to the campus library and read a book about RFID. Meeting the badminton 
                        girl and the soccer girl made me realize that I've never stuck with something for a long time 
                        and done it really well. I usually have a brief, intense interest in things. But whatever, 
                        I'm happy, and that's enough. I don't need to spend a lot of time practicing to prove I'm goodâ€”
                        I'm already doing great!
                    </p>

                        Today, I realized just how much I've changedâ€”or maybe it's more accurate to say that the real me 
                        finally came out! I joined a badminton game with a group of strangers; I only knew two of them, 
                        and even then, we had only met once or twice before.
                        Before the game, I felt confident in my badminton skills. But during the match, I quickly realized 
                        that I had never really played by the rules, and I wasn't as good as I thought. Every time the 
                        shuttlecock came to my left, I missed it about 80% of the time.
                        However, the five people I played with were incredibly kind and patiently taught me. Normally, 
                        I would get nervous and hesitate to play when I'm the weakest one in the group. But they were 
                        so supportive, and I've come to accept that sometimes, I will be the worst in certain areas. 
                        The important thing is to do my best and keep getting stronger.

                        Today, I became the vice monitor of my class. I remember how nervous 
                        I was in the past when I thought about running for a positionâ€”I kept 
                        rehearsing my speech over and over in my mind. But still didn't do well. 
                        But after serving as an interim class leader for the past few days, I've gained
                        some confidence. Even though I might still stumble over my words and lack 
                        perfect logic when I speak, I'm not as timid as I used to be, and I feel 
                        great about it.
                        <br>Initially, I didn't plan on becoming one of the class leader, but these 
                        past few days have made me realize that there are certain skills I need to 
                        develop. While this role may not be the perfect way to build those abilities, 
                        I'm willing to give it a try. Plus, I've made some great friends along the way, 
                        and that makes me really happy today.

                        I started building my own website today, HURRAY!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
                        I'm so happy that I can create something, for free! LOL.
                        Actually I felt hard to fall asleep recently. 
                        I feel very anxiety about my future.
                        I don't know what to do to relieve it.
                        Everynight I go to bed at 12 p.m, but couldn't sleep until 2 a.m.
                        This situation already last for about 2 weeks. 
                        I really miss the days that I could fall asleep in 10 mins.ðŸ˜‚
                        Now I just can't help thinking something have nothing to do with me.
                        Trying hard to get through it!ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

                        This website is a bit ugly.. Beutify it next time.

                        Yesterday, I fell asleep a bit early, like 1 a.m, a biiiig progress!
                        And I also ate a delicious small piece of cake! Like each of them 
                        is as large as my little palm. I can eat 100 pieces!ðŸ¤¤
