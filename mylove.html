                    <p>Today is my baby's birthday. He is a cute baby ‚Äî‚Äî a little catüê±.
                        Sometimes he acts like a adorable puppy, sometimes acts like a strong tiger.
                        No matter what he looks like, I love him sooooo muchü•∞.

                        <p>
                            We met in my college in 2021 Nov. At first he's working hard to building a unmanned aerial vehicle
                            with a bunch of fallen leaves(a very smart cat). I can tell he's trying hard to make the UAV 
                            flying, and even forget to clean his body and eat his favourite fish! I don't pay much attention
                            on him at first. But then, I met him by chance many times. So I just got more and more 
                            familiar with this cat, and help him build a car with leaves.. That's cute. From then on, 
                            we met almost everyday! And I gradually kind of like him and love this little cat. I've try
                            to bring him back home once. But I don't have the ability to make money to feed him or 
                            give him a comfortable home, so I just let him go to live by himselfüò≠.

                        <p>Recently, he's working so hard to make a living. As you known that it's hard
                            to get foods in the cities, and it's full of dangers. There's too many stress.
                            I go to his place every weekend, to check if he's fine. But sometimes when he get ill,
                            he won't let me approach him. He don't want to make me feel ill too. 
                            I need to work harder to make good money, that day I'll come to he
                            and bring him back home ‚Äî‚Äî our home. All I hope now, is that he will be fine and happy.
