                Welcome to Tsingtao! I've been living here for several years, 
                and this city holds so many memories for me. I love the weather here—
                it's always sunny and pleasantly cool. Being so close to the sea 
                offers the best views imaginable.
                I've made many friends here; they are amazing, and I always miss them.

                With a professional camera, this could make an incredible photo.

                First time seeing how a snowflake looks—gorgeous! The gloves were a gift from a 
                former classmate, and they worked great! Unfortunately, I lost one of them.

                This is my favorite spot, offering a perfect view of the sunset. 
                It's at the end of the corridor where I live. I especially love the moments
                right after the sun sets, when it's still bright. It's that magical time between 
                day and night, with the sky looking so pure and transparent.

                After finishing my classes and heading back, I came across a cute snowman, 
                as if it was saying hello to me! It happened to be on my birthday, so I took it 
                as a little surprise just for me. I love the feeling of stumbling upon something 
                interesting like that.

                I was so happy that day—the first snow fell on my birthday! Everything looked perfect. 
                I cherished every inch of snow as a wonderful gift. My mom and dad were also happy for me. 
                They always keep an eye on the weather where I am. Thank you, Mom and Dad!

                When winter comes, the weather in Tsingtao is always so lovely, with wonderful sunshine. 
                I couldn't help but fall in love with this place.

                <strong>[2021 Jan 7]</strong> During that time, the heating system was damaged and under repair.
                The temperature was between -10°C and -16°C! It's freezing cold! Here's how ShiLaoRen Beach looks
                at that time.

                This picture was taken in the classroom while I was studying, with soft sunshine shining down on me. 
                I went to check outside and found the sky was so beautiful! It instantly relieved all my stress.

                I went on an adventure with my roommate, and we explored a dark, scary cave. 
                There was no light inside, and the walls were covered in bat droppings. 
                We came across a snake as soon as we got out!

                I never knew what cherry blossoms looked like until I came to Tsingtao. 
                When the wind blows, it's like a cherry blossom rain. I love it!

                I love the playground. After a 5km jog, it's so nice to lie on top of a tire or just on the ground. 
                I bet I'll really miss this feeling (I did).

                get the best view of Zhanqiao. I visited with a friend who showed me how to 
                take a great photo—haha! This friend took me to many beautiful places I had 
                never been to before. Thank you! I really had a wonderful day!

                 on my own (have no idea why people don't like hiking these days). 
                 The view is absolutely splendid. I took a picture, 
                 and it turned out amazing.

                There's a park near where I live that I visit very often. It's close to the beach and offers 
                a wonderful view. I've been jogging there several times with my partner. This park is incredibly long!

                This picture was taken in Rizhao city. The beach is cleaner than in Tsingtao, 
                and the sand is softer. When the moon shines down, it feels like wandering in a dream.

                <strong>[2023 Dec 17]</strong> This was taken in Yantai city, by my partner.
                It brings back memories of my first big snowball!! It was freezing cold there, 
                with so much snow that the transportation system was completely disrupted.
                P.S: there's no subway, which makes it worse.
