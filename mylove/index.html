                [23 Jul]<em>Our little car.</em>
            </div>
            <p>We participated in a competition and met in the seminar room of the school library. At our first formal meeting, he was wearing a blue striped sweater with a layered shirt underneath. Thankfully, he had washed his hair and taken a shower—haha! He's not the skinny type; he's a little fleshy, but not fat, which I like(great to hug). I have to admit, he was kindof good-looking (for me, and especially with his mask on, and I love the shape of his eyebrow). He mentioned that he remembered I was wearing a red sweater and teased that the shape of my head looked strange (though I think I look perfectly normal).

                [23 Jul 19]<em>Shot on the island.</em>
            </div>
            <p>
                For this competition, we spent almost every day together, and I gradually started to like him. I love the way he looks when he's working and studying. When he's coding, I sometimes feel the urge to lean my head on his shoulder. I don't know when this idea first popped into my head. At first, he would ask what I was doing and why my head was so close to him, but eventually, he just accepted it and seemed to enjoy it. He wouldn't dare move his shoulder when I was resting on it. So sweet.
                One day, he got the same backpack as me—mine is cream-colored, and his is khaki. He even lied, saying he got the backpack before he knew me. We hadn't even confirmed our relationship yet, but having matching backpacks made me feel a bit embarrassed.

                Later, he invited me to visit an island, but I declined, so he went by himself. However, he couldn't reach the island because the ship broke down that day. (Months later, after we confirmed our relationship, he "kidnapped" me to that island.)

                [23 Apr]<em>My bbcat's pull request</em>
            </div>
            <p>    
                After the competition, he asked if he could study with me when I was free. Before he asked, I didn't think I'd see him much afterward because our routines were so different. I also didn't expect us to become boyfriend and girlfriend—I wasn't looking for a relationship at that time. But I still said yes, and we gradually became more and more familiar with each other. 
                We often hung out at the small park in our school, usually late at night after work. The heavy fog made the place look absolutely spectacular.
                Then, one night in the teaching building, he gave me a pull request (Bang! IT guy!):
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This paper marks the beginning of our story!
                I was a bit confused about why he didn't say it directly, so I pretended not to 
                understand and asked him to explain. He was shy but eventually admitted that he 
                liked me and asked me to be his girlfriend. At first, I thought it was strange to 
                write it down on paper, but afterward, I found it to be really cute and unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                To be honest, the early days after we confirmed our relationship were tough. 
                He wanted to see me every minute of every day, which made me feel like I had no 
                personal space. He would get upset(and crazy) if I refused to meet him. It was overwhelming 
                at first, but now, it's reached a point where I actually like it.
            </p>
