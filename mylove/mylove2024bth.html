                        Today is my baby's birthday! He's such a cute little cat üê±. I love him soooo much ü•∞.

                            We met in college in November 2021. At first, he was working hard to build an
                             unmanned aerial vehicle (he's a very smart cat!).
                              I could tell he was really trying to make it fly, so much so that he even forgot
                               to clean himself and have meals. I didn't pay much attention to him at first, 
                               but then I started running into him by chance more and more often. We attended 
                               classes together and worked on building a car by chance. Over time, this led us 
                               to get to know each other better. It was cute. Then we met almost every day, 
                               and I gradually started to really like and then love this little cat. 
                               I even tried to bring him home once. Looking forward to our own home ü§ó.

                            I loved his mind‚Äîhis thought processes were so different from mine. 
                            But our values were so similar, so in sync; everything felt like it was 
                            meant to be. He has never judged me or made me feel less than someone else. 
                            He accepts everything about me, even more than I accept myself.
                            I have never personally experienced this kind of love before him.
                            He makes me feel like he would still love me even if I did nothing 
                            and just laid around every day (even though I wouldn't do it).
                            I'm thankful to have him in my life and regret not meeting him earlier. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, he's been working hard to make a living‚Äîgood 
                            for him! But the stress is really piling up. 
                            I've never felt so deeply that I wanted someone to succeed and be happy.
                            Happy birthday to you! bb! Wish you happy every day!
                        </p>
