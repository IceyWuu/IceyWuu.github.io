        <p>For now, I've learned how to make <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text.
          <br>And I can also add an cute image like this:
        </p>
    
        <img src="./pictures/random/cutecat.png" width="100px">
    
        <p>Awesome! I can even make a list like this!</p>
