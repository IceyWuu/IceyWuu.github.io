            <p>I started building my own website today, HURRAY!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
                I'm so happy that I can create something, for free! LOL.
                Actually I felt hard to fall asleep recently. 
                I feel very anxiety about my future.
                I don't know what to do to relieve it.
                Everynight I go to bed at 12 p.m, but couldn't sleep until 2 a.m.
                This situation already last for about 2 weeks. 
                I really miss the days that I could fall asleep in 10 mins.ðŸ˜‚
                Now I just can't help thinking something have nothing to do with me.
                Trying hard to get through it!ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is a bit ugly.. Beutify it next time.

                Yesterday, I fell asleep a bit early, like 1 a.m, a biiiig progress!
                And I also ate a delicious small piece of cake! Like each of them 
                is as large as my little palm. I can eat 100 pieces!ðŸ¤¤
